## TXL

This `R` code provides basically a feasible generalized spatial 3SLS estimation in the vein of Kelejian and Prucha (2004). The structure of the code and especially the formula part and the output part is heavily inspired by the code in the `spse` package of Gianfranco Piras available at [https://github.com/rforge/spse](https://github.com/rforge/spse).
